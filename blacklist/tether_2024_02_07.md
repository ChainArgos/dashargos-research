# Tether 2024-02-07

Related to [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChainArgos/status/1755463810033533304).
You can find wallets blacklisted on this date [with this dashboard](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/84?Blacklisted+At+Date=2024%2F02%2F07).
The flows in to those wallets make the blacklistings confusing.

There is a related example in the [API documentation](https://docs.chainargos.com/documentation/v/api/looker_api/look_query_multi).

Here is a code snippet sufficient to extract all the inflows to these wallets via the DashArgos API:
```python
sdk = looker_sdk.init40(...)
look = sdk.look(look_id=729) # this is the inflows look, you can set up your own too

# these are the addresses and tokens we care about here
query_filter = {
    "tron_txns.to_address": "TKo62ywGRK7vYXcpBavvmUmwKWgrPtw2Mx,TFWry4G122VJdZNn9uX3HFZ64FeZR4WB13,TRUzWMZnRseD3cZSKLGHvQ8yaiEyQtR2n5,TGm1Kz7W5mWrKp6ibJQvGdG7pXwMg1K1k1,TPXPXxf2rkXTBg1cJw4JfajmHNV8cPJ8B4",
    "tokens.symbol": "USDT",
}

# construct a new query based on the first one, run it and load to a pandas dataframe
new_query = sdk.create_query(body=looker_sdk.models40.WriteQuery(model=look.query.model, view=look.query.view, fields=look.query.fields, filters=look.query_filter))
df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(sdk.run_query(query_id=new_query.id, result_format='csv')))
```
