# YGG Initial Allocations, Vesting & Pump Timing

## Pump Timing
[This look](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/looks/248) shows:
1. On-chain volume
2. The number of on-chain transfers
3. How many unique addresses sent and received

There are two distinct peaks in volume. One on July 17th is not visible in the price chart.
Then the higher peak - with far broader participation - matches the price spike on August 7th.
Go check [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yield-guild-games).

Immediately this looks like pre-pump setup and then the actual pump.
What can we see? Let's start from the beginning.

## Allocations

The stated YGG token allocation is given in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fsDB5szWqPqzuPf5o3KRYl-OvGM6rI6IGCSFUwWQpic/edit?usp=sharing).

Here is a [look](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/looks/250) of all flows out of:
1. [0xCAFEacDaDD29f55ce935492E20F1f982DF3FB51D](https://etherscan.io/token/0x25f8087ead173b73d6e8b84329989a8eea16cf73?a=0xCAFEacDaDD29f55ce935492E20F1f982DF3FB51D) : deployer
2. [0x8E8D8015a7ffA49c83ee7A8773b0f69380cc6552](https://etherscan.io/token/0x25f8087ead173b73d6e8b84329989a8eea16cf73?a=0x8e8d8015a7ffa49c83ee7a8773b0f69380cc6552) : safe multisig / treasury
and into any other wallets, bucketed by month.

Not really close.
More tagging is needed but this is not the stated flow of tokens at all.

## Pumpers

Now lets [look](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/looks/328) at where YGG tokens were coming from
on those two dates.
The "pre-pump" is tokens coming out of team wallets involved in the initial allocation.
They distributed tokens to now-large holders.
The pump was run out of that set of wallets - entirely different from, but linked to, the initial allocation.

You did not want to be short after that token distribution.
There is a difference between "the team is sending XYZ token to exchanges to dump" and
"the team is allocating tokens on-chain."
One of those is a lot closer to the dump than the other.
