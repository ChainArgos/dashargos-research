# Shitcoin Volumes

[This](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/looks/228) is a chart of monthly volume for 10 different shitcoins.
Clicking the symbol at the bottom will enable/disable that series.

Note how some of these like eMax, PEPE and SHIB peak at launch and then trend lower.
Others like HEX and BONE maintain constant volume over a long time.
These things are not all the same.
