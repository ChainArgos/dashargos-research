# Custom measures

Maybe you want to filter by something that is not implemented by default.
Or you want to display two different filter setups side-by-side.

[This look](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/looks/800) shows you how to set up minting and burning your
self.
Minting is set up as a custom measure on "Sum of Transfer Amounts" where the "From Address" is
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
Similarly burning is set up for "To Address" is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

This is a simplisitic example -- you can just use "Amount Minted" and "Amount Burned" -- but shows you how to
do it.
