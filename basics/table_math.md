# Table Math

Maybe you do not like our sign conventions.
Or want to run a calculation that involves several different columns in different ways.
Or just change the formatting of a column of numbers.
The data in DashArgos is editable just like a spreadsheet: you can write whatever formulas you want
with the data you've extracted.

[This look](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/looks/799) use the "table calculation" feature to:
- Add two columns together: Net Amount
- Change the format of a column: Negative Minting Formatted as $
- Do some algebra: Fraction Minting

Each of these is set up as a custom field and you can see how it was set up by editing that field.

You can even hide field you do not want -- for example, if you want to change the formatting you probably
do not want to see our default formatting -- by going to Visualization->Series->Customizations and disabling
"Cell Visualization."
The data is still there but this hides it.
