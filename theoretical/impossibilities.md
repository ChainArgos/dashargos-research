# Impossibilities

This is a collection of impossibility results for decentralized/permissionless systems. The focus here is on math- or CS-style results.

## Other collections

[This blog](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/impossibilities.html) has a slightly different focus and covers some economic-equilibrium-focused papers as well. For example a paper proving that full decentralization is incompatible with a broad class of standard economic assumptions about market participants.

And a limited selection of other economic-equilibrium papers that have come up over the years:

* Oracles
  * [Decentralized Common Knowledge Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01215)
  * [Select-Storage: A New Oracle Design Pattern on Blockchain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9724384)
  * [Blockchain Oracle Design Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09349)
