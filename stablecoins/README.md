# ðŸª™ Stablecoins

There are a lot of useful macro reports you can assemble.

[This](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/19) shows recent volume for a wide range of stablecoins across many blockchains.

And [here](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/27) we track recent minting and burning for a similarly-wide range of products.

On [this dashbaord](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/21?Block+Written+Date=after+2018%2F10%2F09\&Symbol=USDC) you can compare total minting of a given stablecoin over time against the market cap. This starts to give an indication of whether the product is used as a store of value or something more transient.
