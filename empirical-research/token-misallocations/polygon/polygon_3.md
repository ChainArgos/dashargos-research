# General Foundation Odd Flows To Exchanges

[Prior work](https://docs.chainargos.com/documentation/v/research/library/polygon/polygon_2) showed a flow of ~340mm tokens from the foundation to
0x803B74766D8f79195D4DaeCF6f2aac31Dba78F25.

So let's [look at the flows from that address](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/57?To%20or%20From%20Address=0x803B74766D8f79195D4DaeCF6f2aac31Dba78F25&Symbol=).
In addition to the aforementioned 340mm we see an inflow of ~130mm from an "ecosystem growth" wallet.
So ~470mm from insider wallets.

The largest outflow is 185mm to the plasma bridge. But the next two, for ~100mm each, are
0x30b7d95724150c63f58654ac7f52d7674e15e551
and
0x40730f34668afcb3884f050cbc3d376a444bbe44.
We have the latter as another project-connected wallet.

If we look at the first wallet we get [this](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/57?To%20or%20From%20Address=0x30b7d95724150c63f58654ac7f52d7674e15e551&Symbol=).
In addition to the ~100mm discussed above this gets 
~40mm from 0x7a4d86cff2d3df70ef0916c6470aa194c91922cd
and ~20mm from the foundation.
There are also a few smaller inflows.

This wallet deposits ~180mm - everything - to binance.

And just to reinforce how these are clearly insider flows 0x7a4d86cff2d3df70ef0916c6470aa194c91922cd
gets its tokens from the foundation too.
