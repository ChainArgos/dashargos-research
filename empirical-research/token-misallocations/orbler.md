  Another token allocation that is odd and ended in the complete collapse of the

### Orbler

This is an odd one. We tag the core wallets [here](../../project-research/).

### WTF Happened

The staking wallet distributed tokens on an [even monthly schedule](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/179?From+Address=0x8ff19db5b7d712b98026acf692793d47dceece56\&Symbol=ORBR). And none of those destination wallets ever sent the tokens anywhere.

Similarly outflows from the treasury wallet never go anywhere go to dead-ends.

None of the project wallets is even a contract. The circulating supply has always been 2 billion. That means at 2022 prices the market cap was over 50 billion dollars.

#### Exfiltration

The marketing wallet deposits 1.9mm to Mexc and 200k to gate.io. Those are the 1st and 2nd largest deposit-address-receivers of ORBR (there are other smaller inflows).

This looks to be all that happened here. Beyond a tiny amount none of the token was told. The project was not even set up properly. There are no contracts. It is listed on HTX, MEXC, gate.io and then some tiny exchanges. But there was no dumping and no large flows.

This looks like a vacuous project that nobody exploited.
