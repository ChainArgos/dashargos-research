# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Token Misallocations

## 1. The Goal&#x20;

Using DashArgos, you can:&#x20;

* compare the actual token allocation versus the one provided by the project;&#x20;
* determine if there are any unaccounted token allocations to wallet addresses that are not publicly labeled or declared; and&#x20;
* discover price signals, to detect when insiders are "dumping" to exchanges.&#x20;



## 2. The Process

Before you put a single penny down on a token project, find out if insiders are selling ahead of you so you can protect your investment, take a short position, or if you're a VC, ask the team about their token allocation process.&#x20;

1. Obtain all of the declared wallets and initial allocations from the token's documentation, or the research site of the exchange the token is due to be listed on.\

2.  Find out who the largest senders and receivers of a token are by using the premade "Largest Senders and Receivers" Dashboard that comes included with your DashArgos subscription and can be found [here](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/162?Relative+Months+Prior=%5B0%2C48%5D\&Symbol=). Versions also exist for other blockchains.  \
    \
    Use the slider to select the "Relative Months Prior" for your chosen timeframe and select the token symbol you want to check. \

3. Check the largest senders and receivers listed on the Dashboard in Step 2 against the wallet addresses declared by the token team in Step 1 and see if there are any wallets which haven't been identified or listed and transact in significant amounts. \

4. Place any of the addresses that are of interest to you in the "Largest Counterparties for Address" Dashboard that you can find [here](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/dashboards/57?To+or+From+Address=\&Symbol=). Versions also exist for other blockchains.   \

5. Repeat Step 4 for as many times as you need until you can reconcile all of the addresses and token allocations from Step 1, with Steps 2 to 4. \

6. If all the tokens have been allocated as promised, and those that should be lock contracts are locked, and those that are team multisigs are team multisigs, and all is good, go back to Step 2 regularly to keep an eye on things. DashArgos subscribers can receive automated alerts of major token movements via API, email, Amazon S3, Webhook and SFTP. \

7. If all the tokens have not been allocated as promised, then keep an eye on any tokens being moved out of the addresses you need to monitor. DashArgos subscribers can receive automated alerts of token movements out of specific addresses via API, email, Amazon S3, Webhook and SFTP. \

8. That's it. Good luck!&#x20;
